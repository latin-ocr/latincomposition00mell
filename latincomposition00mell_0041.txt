CLASS WORK

During the same year in which Caesar led his army
into Germany‚ he determined to go to Britain. He accord-
ingly set sail from Port Itius with two legions, and reached
the island in a few hours. There his brave soldiers jumped
down into the deep water1 and drove off the Britons who
were trying to keep them from the shore. A few days
later, a great storm damaged the ships so that twelve were
useless for sailing. Caesar caused the rest to be repaired
and, having again defeated the Britons, returned to Gaul.
