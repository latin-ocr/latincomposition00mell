This book is the outgrowth of many years of thought and successful
experience, and will be found carefully adapted to its purpose as a guide
for Latin students during their first year's study. It embodies the
improvements in Latin teaching which have commended themselves to
enlightened experience.

The pupil is early introduced to the connected text of Caesar, but
that this introduction may not be too abrupt the first sixteen lessons con-
tain an orderly presentation of the commonest forms and rules of the
language.

The text is chosen especially for its simplicity and interest, and the
total amount presented is greater than the second, third, or fourth books
of the Gallie XVar, and meets the recommendations of the Committee of
Twelve of the American Philological Association. ’

Special attention is given to the Vocabulary. New words are com-
pared with words previously learned, and a constant review of old words
is kept up by means of abundant, easy exercises.

The exercises are abundant, well graded, and progressive. In
addition to the regular exercises for practice in translation, nearly every
lesson contains Oral Exercises for class work and W'ritten Exercises
intended to serve as a review of topics and constructions previously
studied.

A summary of Latin forms, with reference to the paragraphs of the
book in which the given paradigms are'treated, follows the regular
lessons. Pupils will find these forms convenient for use and reference
in their studies. A full and well selected vocabulary completes the
book.
