written exercises and translations, for conversational exercises, and for
grammatieal study. The student is encouraged from the first to speak
and write German as the best means of gaining an intelligent knowledge

and use of the language.

The plan of this work will commend itself to teachevrs who believe
that the teaching of German literature should concern itself with the
contents and meaning of the great works themselves more than with a
critical study of what has been said about the works, With this aim the
author gives a survey of the language and literature at its most important
epochs, selecting for detailed study the chief works of each period and
writer. A summary of the contents of each work so treated is given,
generally illustrated by a quotation from the work.

The simplicity of the treatment and language adapts this work for

younger students as well as for those of more advanced grades.
