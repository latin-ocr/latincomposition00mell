CLASS WORK

In the consulship1 of Piso and Gabinius, the Helvetii
attempted to go out of their territories to Aquitania. Their
country was only two hundred and forty miles long, and
so they could not easily make war. Orgetorix, whom they
chose as leader, died; nevertheless they made the attempt,
and came to Geneva. Caesar, however, fought with them
and sent them home.
