PREFACE

THIS little book has grown out of a need felt in my
own Caesar classes for some easy but systematic work in
Latin Composition. Its purpose is not to present in most
comprehensive fashion all the peculiarities of Latin syn-
taX, but by constant repetition to fix in the student’s mind
some of the simplest constructions of nouns and verbs,
All special grammatical notes in the several lessons have
been omitted, that the pupil may early form the habit
of constant reference to his grammar. Since the book is
to be used in connection with Caesar, the constructions
emphasized are those recurring most frequently in his
text. Imperatives and independent subjunctives have
therefore been lightly touched upon. The 'more difficult
varieties of final and consecutive clauses and of relative
sentences have been purposely omitted, from the convic-
tion that the child should understand the rule before he
considers its exceptionS.

The finding of phrases illustrative of. the principles of
syntax introduced in each lesson has been left to the
teacher as a valuable class-room exercise. It has been
my own practice to have the sections marked “Class
Work’' written without the aid of the grammar, making
each pupil depend for forms and rules entirely upon his
own memory. I have also found that a clear tabular
statement of the principles studied‚ with the proper refer·
ences to the grammar, is ofgreat help in reviewing. Such
