The Academic French Conrse embodies in two books a
complete system of instruction in the French language for
English-speaking pupils. The course is remarkable for the
simplicity of its grammatical treatment and for the care-
fully selected vocabulary employed in the exercises and
translations. It is eminently practical, advancing in a
constant gradation from the easiest of first steps to those
more difficult. Only essential rules are given, and those
in the most concise form. Besides the usual grammatical
driIl, it includes lessons in con-versational form, entitled
“A Trip to Paris,'’ replete with information of the most
practical kind and largely increasing the student's vocab-
ulary with an extensive variety of expressions in daily use
among the educated classes in France.

This is prepared on the same general lines, and though
brief is comprehensive. The grammatical topics discussed
have been wisely chosen, and all topics of primary import-
ance are fully treated, The exercises in reading and
writingFrench furnish abundant practice on all points of
syntax. The book contains a valuable chapter on French
Phonetics, as well as the poetry prescribed for memorizing
by the Regents of the University of the State of New York.
It is especially noteworthy in that it conforms in all re-
spects to the radical reform incorporated in the new laws
of syntax officially promulgated by the Minister of Public
Instruction of the French Republic, on March 11, 1901.
