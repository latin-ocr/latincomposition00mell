ΒΥ JAMES C. EGRERT, JR., Ph.D.
Adjunct Professor of Latin, Columbia University

Half Morocco. large 12mo, 468 pages. With numerous illustrations and
exact reproductions of inscriptions . . . . Ρτῐεε, 5350

This work is designed as a text-book for the use of
students in Universities and Colleges‚ and also to furnish
an account of this branch of archaeological study for
general readers. It has been prepared in the belief that

a knowledge of epigraphy forms an essential part of the
equipment of a teacher of the classics‚ and that the sub-
ject itself has become so important as to justify its intro-
duction‚ in elementary form at least, into the curriculum
of undergraduate studies.

A distinctive feature of the book is the number and
character of its illustrations‚—there being'over seven
hundred euts and diagrams of inscriptions, for the pur-
pose of illustrating the text, and for practice in reading.
Of these, over one hundred are photographic repro-
ductions‚ showing the forms of the letters and the
arrangement of the inscriptions. The work is also sup-
plied with an exhaustive bibliography and valuable tables
of abbreviations‚ archaisms‚ etc. ἢ

Copies of Egbert's Latin Inscriptions will be sent, prepaz'd‚ to any address
on receipt of tlze price by tlze Publz'shers .·
