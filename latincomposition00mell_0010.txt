4 PREFACE

a table each class may provide for itself by adding to
the several topics in Lessons XIV and XXV the numbers
of the paragraphs in its own grammar which bear upon
the subject.

In addition to the general vocabulary at the end of the
book, common words have been grouped together in the
special vocabularies which should be committed to mern-
ory as a part of each lesson.

The object, then, of the book is to guide the pupil along
the beginning of the road to a knowledge of Latin. It
will not have failed entirely of its purpose if it does noth-
ing more than teach a proper regard for the concordS.

Thanks are due to the friends whose suggestions and
interest have been helpfuL and especially to Dr. Charles
Knapp of Barnard College for careful reading and correctÎ‡

ing of the proof.
