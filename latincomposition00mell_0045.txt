During the next summer, Caesar, having left part of his
army in Gaul, returned to Britain with five legions and the
cavalry. After the army had disembarked‚ Caesar has-
tened against the enemy. He marched twelve miles that
night, and fought with the Britons near a small river. On
’ the following day, however, a messenger came to report
that a storm had damaged the ships. After delaying ten
days for the sake of repairing these, he set out again
against greater forces of the Britons. His army, however,
easily drove them off, and, the next day, crossed the river
Thames. Then the tribes began to send ambassadors to
ask for peace. A few days later, Caesar led his legions
back to the sea and embarked. All his ships reached Gaul
unharmed.
