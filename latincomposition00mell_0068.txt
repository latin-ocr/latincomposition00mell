This grammar gives, in clear and concise outline, the
essential features of the language. The author combines,
in an unusual degree, an intimate knowledge of the Spanish
language and of its idioms rarely found save in a native
Spaniard‚ with the pedagogical devices and the insight into
the needs of American students which only an American
instructor of long experience can possess. The union of
these two features places the book in the front rank of
practical working text-books.

An especially serviceable feature of the book is the intro-
duction of numerous business letters and forms, copied from
those actually used by one of the leading Spanish firms in
this country. Both the exercises and the Spanish reading
matter, covering‚ as they do, a very wide range of subjects‚
embrace many features which serve as an introduction to
an acquaintance with the commercial and social life of
Spanish-speaking countries. No other grammar so thor-
oughly meets this want, and a mastery of its contents will
place the student in a position where he may readily develop
and apply his linguistic knowledge along these lines.

In view of the constantly growing importance of our
relations with our Spanish-speaking possessions and neigh-
bors, a book which will equip the student thoroughly with
an accurate and ready knowledge of the language both for
reading and conversation is an essential in all schools.
Embodying methods employed and tested in many years
of class-room instruction, this is such a book, and its use
cannot fail to give results amply proportionate to the study
expended on it.
