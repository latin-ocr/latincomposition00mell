After the death of OrgetoriX, the Helvetii tried to march
out of their country through the Roman province. But
the Roman legion which was with Caesar, and the soldiers
that he had ordered from the province fortified the road
and stopped them. Dumnorix, whom they sent as ambas-
sador, persuaded the Sequani to let1 them march through
their country. Will not these warlike men be hostile to
the Aedui, friends of the Roman people?
