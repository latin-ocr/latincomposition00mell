The purpose of this book is to combine a thorough and
systematic study of the essentials of Greek syntax With
abundant practice in translating connected Idiomatic
English into Greek, and to afford constant practice in
writing Greek at sight.

Part I contains, in graded lessons, the principal points
of Greek syntax Which require especial emphasis in Second
Year Greek. These lessons are designed to serve as a
partial review of the first year's work and as an intro-
duction to the composition work in connection with the
reading of Xenophon's Anabasis,

Part II contains short, simple English sentences, based
on Books I—IV of the Anabasis, designed to be used in
connection with the reading of the text.

Part III contains connected English prose, based on
Books I-IV of the Anabasis.

Review Lessons are introduced at intervals, containing
a list of the important words and an enumeration of the
principal constructions used in the preceding sentences.

The book is provided with an English-Greek Vocabulary
and contains a selection of recent college entrance exam-
ination papers in Greek prose composition, for the purpose
of supplying further material for practice and of familiar-
izing the student with the nature of the examinations set
by the various colleges.
